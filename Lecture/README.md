# Linear Feedback Control - Winter 2024

This repository contains all my work related to the **Linear Feedback Control** course conducted in Winter 2024 at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Campus of K. N. Toosi University of Technology by Dr. Hamidreza Taghirad. The course aims to introduce the basic concepts of linear feedback control and emphasize the analysis and design of feedback control systems, especially in terms of stability.

## üìå Overview

The course covers various aspects of control systems, with special focus on:

- **System Modeling**: Introduction to Laplace transforms, transfer functions, block diagrams, flow graphs, and Mason's rule.
- **Time Response Analysis**: Characteristics of first and second-order systems, transient responses, and steady-state errors.
- **Stability Analysis**: Application of Routh-Hurwitz criteria, Root Locus, and frequency domain methods (Bode, Nyquist, Nichols charts).
- **Feedback Compensation and Controller Design**: Static and dynamic feedback compensation, and design of controllers like PID, Lead-Lag using frequency response methods.
- **Advanced Topics**: Sensitivity-based feedback controller design, including techniques for handling unstable and non-minimum phase systems.

## üóìÔ∏è Course Schedule

The course covers the following topics week by week:

- **Week 1**: Introduction to feedback systems, components, and performance characteristics.
- **Week 2**: System representation using transfer functions, block diagrams, and Mason‚Äôs rule.
- **Week 3**: Time response analysis for first and second-order systems.
- **Week 4**: Stability analysis using Routh-Hurwitz criteria.
- **Week 5-7**: Root Locus analysis and controller design (P, PD, Lead, Lag controllers).
- **Week 8-10**: Frequency analysis, Bode plots, Nyquist diagrams, and stability analysis via Nyquist criterion.
- **Week 11**: Resonance and bandwidth in frequency response.
- **Week 12-14**: Dynamic feedback design, stability margins, controller design based on sensitivity, and controller tuning techniques.
