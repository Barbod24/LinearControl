# Research Projects

This repository contains research papers and reports on various control systems topics. Each research project explores different aspects of control systems, including time-domain vs. frequency-domain analysis, delay systems, and derivatives in control analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository includes the following research topics:

- **Research 1**: Comparison of Time-Domain and Frequency-Domain Analysis â€“ A detailed comparison of the two methods, including their advantages, disadvantages, and when each is most useful in control systems analysis.
- **Research 2**: Root Locus Plotting for Time-Delayed Systems â€“ A comprehensive study on how to plot the root locus for systems with time delay and how it affects system stability.
- **Research 3**: Why We Differentiate with Respect to Rows in the Routh-Hurwitz Criterion â€“ Exploring the need to differentiate with respect to rows when applying the Routh-Hurwitz criterion for stability analysis.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

To read and understand the research papers and reports, you may need:

- Background knowledge in control systems analysis.
- MATLAB (if applying the techniques described in Research 2 for plotting or system simulation).
