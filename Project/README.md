# Control System Design Project

This repository contains various implementations and analyses related to control system design. It includes modeling, controller design, and system analysis using Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and analyze control systems using different methods, including:

- **System Modeling**: Representing dynamic systems using transfer functions and state-space models.
- **Controller Design**: Implementing controllers like PID, lead-lag, state feedback, and optimal controllers.
- **Stability Analysis**: Evaluating system stability using Nyquist, Bode, and root locus plots.
- **Simulation & Performance Evaluation**: Testing control designs under different conditions.
