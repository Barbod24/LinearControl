# MATLAB Homework & Project Codes

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and functions related to my homework and project assignments in control system design and analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The repository includes:

- **Homework Solutions**: MATLAB implementations of theoretical and computational problems.
- **Project Files**: Scripts and Simulink models for control system design and simulation.
- **Control Analysis**: Stability analysis, root locus, Bode plots, Nyquist plots, and system responses.
- **Controller Design**: PID, lead-lag, state feedback, and optimal control techniques.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

To run these files, you need:

- MATLAB (preferably R2020a or later)
- Control System Toolbox
- Simulink (if using Simulink models)
