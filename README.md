# LinearControl

This course was conducted in Winter 2024 at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Campus of K. N. Toosi University of Technology by Dr. Hamidreza Taghirad. This repository contains all my work related to the course, including assignments, research, code, and other relevant files.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository includes:

- **Assignments**: MATLAB scripts and solutions to homework assignments on various control systems topics, including system modeling, stability analysis, controller design, and simulation.
- **Research Projects**: In-depth research papers and reports on control systems topics, such as time-domain vs. frequency-domain analysis, root locus for time-delayed systems, and the Routh-Hurwitz criterion.
- **Code**: MATLAB and Python code for control system analysis, including root locus plots, Bode plots, Nyquist plots, and more.
- **Other Files**: Relevant files and documentation related to the course projects and research.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need:

- MATLAB (preferably R2020a or later)
- Control System Toolbox (for MATLAB scripts)
- Simulink (if applicable for certain tasks)

For Python-related code:

- Python (preferably 3.x or later)
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `control`
