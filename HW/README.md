# Control System Homework Solutions

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for various control system analysis and design topics. The homework assignments cover system modeling, Mason's method, second-order system characteristics, stability analysis, controller design, and more.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository includes solutions to the following topics:

HW1. **Modeling and Mason's Rule**: Modeling control systems and applying Masonâ€™s method for block diagram reduction.
HW2. **Second-Order System Time Response Characteristics & Steady-State Error**: Analyzing transient response, settling time, overshoot, and steady-state error for a second-order system.
HW3. **Root Locus**: Generating root locus plots for stability analysis and understanding system behavior as the gain changes.
HW4. **Bode Plot & Nyquist Plot**: Plotting the frequency response of the system using Bode and Nyquist plots for stability and system analysis.
HW5. **Phase Margin & Gain Margin**: Analyzing the phase and gain margins to assess system stability and performance.
HW6. **Controller Design**: Designing controllers (e.g., PID, lead-lag, state feedback) to meet desired performance criteria.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

To run these scripts, you need:

- MATLAB (preferably R2020a or later)
- Control System Toolbox
